* This is a new submission (R3)

1. The DESCRIPTION file was modified to include references in the format suggested.

2. The @return or \value field was documented in all functions

3. The function that referenced the `.GlobalEnv` and have instead referenced it with `env = parent.frame()` instead with the intent to comply with CRAN policies. Our goal was to maintain the user's environment when they called the function `formula.tm()`. This is similar to the `stats::formula()` default argument (and hope its okay to have modeled our function after it).

4. There remained an old latex symbol (\textrightarrow) that was causing manual building issues. We had fixed a majority of these the first time, but unfortunately missed one. It has now been fixed. To confirm, I've performed a recursive `grep` through all of the source files to confirm.
