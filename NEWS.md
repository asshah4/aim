# volundr 0.0.0.9000

This is current developmental version. 

## Next Steps

- Method for incorporation of other testing mechanisms (e.g. `lm()` and `t.test()`)
- Development of path-based functions
- Addition of confounding measurements based on hypothesis
- Regeneration of hypotheses and functions

## Features

These functions are currently stable, and should continue to have similar inputs and outputs. Over time, there should be expansion in their use.
