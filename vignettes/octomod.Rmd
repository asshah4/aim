# Introduction to the *Octobeast*

In supervised learning research projects, particularly those with multiple outcomes, the number of models and tests that are performed can become quite lengthy. The `octomod` package tries to tackle this by providing hypothesis organization.

By specifying at the beginning how a model or test should be setup, it becomes easier to implement the overall plan.
