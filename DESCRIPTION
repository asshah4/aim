Description: A system for describing and manipulating the many models that are
    generated in causal inference and data analysis projects, as based on the
	  causal theory and criteria of Austin Bradford Hill (1965) 
	  <doi:10.1177/003591576505800503>. This system includes the addition of 
	  formal attributes that modify base `R` objects, including terms and 
	  formulas, with a focus on variable roles in the "do-calculus" of modeling,
	  as described in Pearl (2010) <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1203>. For example, the 
	  definition of exposure, outcome, and interaction are  implicit in the roles 
	  variables take in a formula. These premises allow for a more fluent modeling
	  approach focusing on variable relationships, and assessing effect 
	  modification, as described by VanderWeele and Robins (2007) 
	  <doi:10.1097/EDE.0b013e318127181b>. The essential goal is to help 
	  contextualize formulas and models in causality-oriented workflows.
