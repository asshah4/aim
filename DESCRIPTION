Description: A simple and tidy way to organize the many models built during a 
    research project. The package consists of individual hypothesis objects that 
    are all linked together around a single data set. In causality-based 
    research, such as epidemiology, the focus is on specific hypothesis that can
    be tested. However, the number of models can become unruly. This serves as a 
    way to organize the many.
