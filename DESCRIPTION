Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Anish",
           family = "Shah",
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),

Description: The language provided is intended to help organize many models that
    are generated in the process of causal inference in data analysis. The 
    specific classes and functions emphasize the importance of variable
    relationships (e.g. exposure, outcome, confounding terms) and helps 
    contextualize formulas and models.
