Description: Organize many models and hypotheses, generate directed acyclic 
    graphs from these models, and cut out variables in a causality-based 
    approach to analyses. The package consists of formulating hypothesis, 
    testing the relationships, and analyzing the parameters. In causality-based 
    studies, the focus is on understanding and contextualizing variables. This
    package provides methods to understand the relationships between outcomes, 
    exposures, and other covariates.
