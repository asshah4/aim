Description: A simple and tidy way to organize the many models built during a 
    research project. The package consists of formulating hypothesis, testing or
    modeling the findings, and understanding the parameters. In causality-based 
    research, such as epidemiology, the focus is on a specific aim that 
    can be tested, which helps to contextualize variables, and provides 
    relationships between outcomes, exposures, and covariates. This package 
    attempts to provide a framework for these types of analyses.
