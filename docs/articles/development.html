<p>The development of this project was inspired by the a problem of
organizing many different hypotheses while writing my thesis. I had
several data sets and many, many models, and had trouble with how to
store and recall them. I wanted an easier way to pull my thoughts
together, creating a dynamic structure that would unfold along with the
research project itself.</p>
<p>The structure, <strong>which is still being iterated</strong>, is
about an easy-to-understand interface that allows the following major
concepts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identifying core data that will be queried with specific
hypothesis</li>
<li>Ability to handle grouping/strata of that data for subsets of
analyses</li>
<li>Forming hypotheses of multiple outcomes and multiple predictors with
an epidemiological angle (e.g. <em>exposures</em>, <em>outcomes</em>,
<em>covariates</em>)</li>
<li>Running and updating tests as the data changes</li>
<li>Extracting or recalling models as the research project
progresses</li>
</ol>
<p>As minimally-experienced programmer, I used examples of current
effective packages while designing the API.</p>

<p>The features that I found missing in these was the ability to handle
a variety of formulas that had specific pre-defined hypotheses, and the
focus had been to <em>compare</em> or <em>combine</em> models, instead
of considering the focus on causality. Essentially, I wanted a more
epidemiological approach. The <em>easystats</em> archetype of R
“monsters” was partially the idea for the working name of
<strong>{aims}</strong>. I started writing this after reading <a href="https://blog.simonpcouch.com/blog/dev-docs-p1/" class="external-link">this blogpost</a>

<p>The project name has gone through many iterations. The reason why the
name was important is that the correct <em>metaphor</em> helps the
planning process, providing a schema for understanding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By" class="external-link">Metaphors We
Live By</a> by Lakoff was fundamental in this understanding for me.</p>

<h3 id="first-draft">First Draft<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#first-draft"></a>
</h3>
<p>I’ve currently defined the basic functions as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>octomod()</code> initializes the modeling structure</li>
<li>
<code>core()</code> defines the core data of the
<code>octomod</code> structure, allowing tests to be performed from a
centralized data set</li>
<li>
<code>arm()</code> creates individual arms to the
<code>octomod</code>, which reference a specific family of
hypotheses</li>
<li>
<code>equip()</code> gives each of the arms a <em>tidied</em> output
including model fit and parameters, which can subsequently be
called</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of this are I can flexibly change the core data, give
specific formulas that can be expanded/varied, fit independently, and
extracted in a list-column based format.</p>
<p>The problems are that “changing” the central dataset is dangerous,
the structure doesn’t hold together afterwards, and fitting the data may
break older models.</p>

<div class="section level3">

</h3>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="core-functions">Core Functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#core-functions"></a>
</h4>
<p>As described, the name helps to determine the function’s purpose. The
core functions represent the major user-facing features. They also help
to identify the underlying structure needed to store the data
collected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>project()</code> initializes a structure that holds and can
retain information about the individual project aims or study arms</li>
<li>
<code>set_data()</code> attaches a specific data frame to the
<code>project</code> object</li>
<li>
<code>add_arm()</code> creates a hypothesis-driven series of tests
around a formula, and allows for multiple tests to be described
simultaneously (e.g. sequential addition of covariates)</li>
<li>
<code>build_models()</code> runs the tests, whether it is basic
statistics or more complex inferential models, with the capacity to
update only the newly added arms</li>
<li>
<code>collect_findings()</code> recalls information from the
<code>project</code> structure in a flexible way</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="project-structure">Project Structure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-structure"></a>
</h4>
<p>The overall project structure requires a specific <em>class</em> that
will contain a pattern of an internal structure. The
<code>project</code> object should hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>a space to hold the data set</li>
<li>a <em>tidy</em> table that holds each <code>arm</code> as a separate
row, containing columns for the title, formula combinations,
modifiers/options, description, and build/run status</li>
<li>a corresponding <em>tidy</em> table that holds the results of each
<code>arm</code> after it has been run</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="third-draft">Third Draft<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#third-draft"></a>
</h3>
<p>I realized this approach was not effective in that it was overly
complicated in having multiple names, data frames, and connections
between them. I simplified the pipeline to focus on a specific S3
classes that could be used to generate hypotheses, and iterate through
to help look at variable relationship.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">study</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op"><a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html" class="external-link">%&gt;%</a></span></span>

<span>    <span class="fu">build_study</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Essentially, this was a list based concept of adding hypotheses to a
modified list/tibble structure that had important data stored as
attributes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fourth-draft">Fourth Draft<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fourth-draft"></a>
</h3>
<p>I decided that I was not really seeing the big picture. What I wanted
was a way to store a set of multiple tests with the purpose of studying
the relationship between two variables (an exposure and an outcome), and
potentially looking at covariates. The <em>basic</em> concept was
essentially a <strong>directed acyclic graph</strong>, with the
relationships storing the hypotheses that were tested. The functionality
was the same, but the API was different.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="classes">Classes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#classes"></a>
</h4>
<p>The major classes needed would be …</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>hypothesis</code> object, that showed and/or carried the
relationship between variables, likely a complex formula object</li>
<li>
<code>map</code> object that drew the relationships between the
variables, and allowed for the storage of multiple tests</li>
<li>
<code>path</code> object that is extracted after the map has been
drawn (if you will), should be able to be evaluated to help understand
which variables may be confounders, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="confounding">Confounding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#confounding"></a>
</h4>
<p>A purpose of having parallel and sequential model sets, built into a
hypothesis, was to identify confounding variables and help remove
them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fifth-draft">Fifth Draft<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fifth-draft"></a>
</h3>
<p>Hopefully the final draft. I simplified the API to exclude the
complexity of path analysis and focused just on the hypotheses and
fitting models. I also removed the complexity of formula management, and
placed that into a separate package.</p>
