The goal of `marksman` is to help organize data, hypotheses, and
analyses during research forays, providing a strategic and smart
approach at hitting the target of research questions.

The inspiration came from the fact that when applying for any research
project, specific aims were required, which came with their own
hypotheses. The results of these were important, whether or not they
were significant. This is a more *supervised learning* approach,
compared to the *unsupervised learning* in more machine learning /
statistical schools of thought.

It heavily borrows from the `tidymodels` approach to modeling, and
sharpens the focus to help with specific research projects.
