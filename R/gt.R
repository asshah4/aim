#' Extensions of `{gt}` package for multiple models
#'
#' The related functions in this package combine multiple models to help show
#' the relationship between variables.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The extensions that combine the modeling functions of the `{vlndr}` package
#' and table-making functions of the `{gt}` package require some conventions to
#' simplify the process. These conventions are listed and explained below.
#'
#' # Formula inputs
#'
#' When providing pluralized arguments, such as for __outcomes__, __exposures__,
#' __interactions__, and __strata__, both the variable itself and its potential
#' label are of interest. These *labeled formulas* are handled generally by the
#' function [labeled_formulas_to_named_list()] The input types are (in order of
#' preference/informativity):
#'
#' - `<list>` of `<formula>` objects: The **LHS** is always the name of the variable that will be selected. The **RHS** is the potential label for the output table.
#' - `<formula>` object
#' - `<character>` vector
#'
#' @param object A `<mdl_tbl>` object with the required models. It must also
#'   contain the original dataset used to create the models of interest. Please
#'   see [attach_data()] for details.
#'
#' @param data The original dataset used to create the models of interest. The
#'   variables in the model must be contained within this dataset. This may also
#'   be attached
#'
#' @param outcomes A `<formula>` or list of formulas selecting the outcome
#'   variables of interest. The **LHS** is always the name of the variable that
#'   will be selected. The **RHS** is the potential label for the output table.
#'
#' @param exposures A `<formula>` or list of formulas of strata that should be
#'   evaluated, with the **LHS** referring to the strata and the **RHS**
#'   referring to its label.
#'
#' @param interactions A `<formula>` or list of formulas of the interaction
#'   terms that should be evaluated, with the **LHS** referring to the term and
#'   the **RHS** referring to its label. Currently only supports binary
#'   interaction terms.
#'
#' @param strata A `<formula>` or list of formulas of strata that should be
#'   evaluated, with the **LHS** referring to the strata and the **RHS**
#'   referring to its label.
#'
#' @param level_labels A `<formula>` or list of formulas where each list-element
#'   is a formula with the **LHS** reflecting either the variable to re-label or
#'   a specific level, and the **RHS** reflecting what the new level should be
#'   called (for display). If there are conflicting labels, the most recent will
#'   be used.
#'
#'   For example, `list(am ~ c("Manual", "Automatic")` would take, from the
#'   `mtcars` dataset, the `am` variable, which consists of `c(0, 1)`, and
#'   relabel them in the order described. They are sorted in ascendinng order
#'   prior to re-labeling.
#'
#'   The alternative approach is to use the specific level itself and have it
#'   re-labeled. `list(0 ~ "Absent")` would take all levels that are zero, and
#'   change their value.
#'
#' @param terms A `<formula>` or list of formulas selecting the model terms that
#'   should be used. The **LHS** is always the name of the variable that will be
#'   selected. The **RHS** is the potential label for the output table.
#'
#' @param columns Columns that help to describe the individual terms of a model.
#'   Generally describes the statistical estimates or properties of an  exposure
#'   term. At least one column should likely be selected from this list. The
#'   sequence listed will reflect the sequence shown in the table. This is given
#'   as a `<formula>` or list of formulas, with the **LHS** is the name of an
#'   acceptable variable, and the **RHS** is the potential column label. The
#'   current options are:
#'
#'   * beta = point estimate value, such as odds ratio or hazard ratio
#'
#'   * conf = inclusion of the confidence interval (presumed to be ~95%-ile)
#'
#'   * n = number of observations in each group or subset
#'
#'   * p = p_value for model or interaction term
#'
#'   For example: `list(beta ~ "Hazard", conf ~ "95% CI" n ~ "No.")"`
#'
#'   Notably, the columns do not describe the terms, but the data contained in
#'   the rows below. The `terms` and `level_labels` arguments serve as the
#'   spanning labels for the related columns. Please see [gt::tab_spanner()] for
#'   more information on how spanners work.
#'
#' @param accents A `<formula>` or list of formulas that provide instructions
#'   on how to emphasize or accentuate certain data cells within the table.
#'   Similar to the `columns` argument, the **LHS** refers to the data available
#'   in the columns, such as the *p* or *beta* value, but is stated as a
#'   criteria, e.g. `p < 0.05`. The **RHS** is the instruction on what type of
#'   accentuation to perform. This applies to *ALL* data columns of the table,
#'   if the criteria are met.
#'
#'   The **LHS** options are:
#'
#'   * beta = point estimate value
#'
#'   * conf_low = lower bound of the confidence interval
#'
#'   * conf_high = upper bound of the confidence interval
#'
#'   * p = p-value for a model term
#'
#'   The current **RHS** options are:
#'
#'   * bold = apply bold labeling to text
#'
#' @param suppress_column_labels A `<logical>` value that determines if the
#'   column labels should be suppressed and replaced by the term labels.
#'
#'   This defaults to `TRUE` when only a single column label is chosen. In this
#'   case, the individual term level labels are used, which are obtained either
#'   explicitly through the **level_labels** argument or through the default
#'   levels from the original data.
#'
#'   If multiple columns are chosen to be displayed, then the column labels by
#'   default are retained (argument is `FALSE`). Occasionally, several columns
#'   will be initially selected and subsequently *hidden* by the user such that
#'   only a single column (per term) remains. This is a use case to force the
#'   column labels to be suppressed.

#' Compact and minimal theme for `gt` tables
#'
#' This theme was used for placing somewhat larger tables into `xaringan` slides
#' by making the spacing more compact and decreasing the font size. The exposed
#' variables are to control font size and table width, but any option from the
#' `gt` package is allowed.
