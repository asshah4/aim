\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{mdl_tbl} object with the required models}

\item{data}{The original dataset used to create the models of interest. The
variables in the model must be contained within this dataset.}

\item{outcomes}{Is a formula or list of formulas selecting the outcome
variables of interest. The LHS is always the name of the variable that will
be selected. The RHS is the potential label for the output table. If no
label is desired, can place an \code{NA} value on RHS of formula.}

\item{followup}{Character vector naming the followup duration variable. Must
be either same length as \strong{outcomes} or be of length of 1 (which will be
recycled).}

\item{terms}{Is a \code{formula} or \code{list} of formulas selecting the model terms that
should be used. The LHS is always the name of the variable that will be
selected. The RHS is the potential label for the output table. If no label
is desired, can place an \code{NA} value on RHS of formula.}

\item{rate_difference}{If there are only two levels in the term, the rate
difference between the levels will be calculated. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
Presumes a 95\% confidence interval as the default. If \code{TRUE} will calculate
the rate by the \strong{person_years} provided.}

\item{person_years}{The length or duration of person-years to use. Is an
integer, and usually is 10 or 100. Default is \code{100}, which would represent
the incidence for every \emph{100 person-years}. Argument only used if
\strong{rate_difference} is set to \code{TRUE}. Currently not working!}

\description{
Function that takes a \code{mdl_tbl} object that includes survival-model data,
usually in the form of Cox proportional hazard models, and allows them to be
displayed.
