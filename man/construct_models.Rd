construct_models(study, which_ones = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{study}{Object of class \code{study}}

\item{which_ones}{Vector of which hypothesis should be built. Defaults to
building all hypotheses that have not been run yet. If given a name, will
forcibly re-run the analysis.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{study} object that has be fitted and tidied.
}
\description{
This function allows for delayed building of multiple hypothesis. It uses the
\code{hypothesis} objects with the corresponding \strong{test} arguments against the
prescribed \strong{data}. Which hypotheses to run can be specified, which will
forcibly re-run these, otherwise the default behavior is to only run models
that have not yet been fitted.
