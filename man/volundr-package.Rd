\description{
Organize many models and hypotheses, generate directed acyclic graphs from these models, and cut out variables in a causality-based approach to analyses. The package consists of formulating hypothesis, testing the relationships, and analyzing the parameters. In causality-based studies, the focus is on understanding and contextualizing variables. This package provides methods to understand the relationships between outcomes, exposures, and other covariates.
