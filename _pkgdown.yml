  title: Language to Manage Many Models
  description: >
    A system for describing and manipulating the many models that are
    generated in causal inference and data analysis projects, as based on the
    causal theory and criteria of Austin Bradford Hill (1965) 
    <doi:10.1177/003591576505800503>. This system includes the addition of 
    formal attributes that modify base `R` objects, including terms and 
    formulas, with a focus on variable roles in the "do-calculus" of modeling, 
    as described in Pearl (2010) <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1203>. For example, 
    the  definition of exposure, outcome, and interaction are implicit in the 
    roles  variables take in a formula. These premises allow for a more fluent 
    modeling approach focusing on variable relationships, and assessing effect 
    modification, as described by VanderWeele and Robins (2007) 
    <doi:10.1097/EDE.0b013e318127181b>. The essential goal is to help
    contextualize formulas and models in causality-oriented workflows.
