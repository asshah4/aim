```

## Introduction

The package `vlndr` was intended as a way to handle causal- and epidemiology-based modeling by the following principles:

1. Role determination of variables
2. Generativity in formula creation
3. Multiple model management

The name is an acronym for "**V**ariables of **L**arge **N**umbers; **D**idn't **R**egress" It also lexically represents the word **v√∂lundr**, the Norse name for Wayland the Smith, in the spirit of *forging* together many models. 

## Usage

The package is simple to use. First, lets load the basic packages. The `mtcars` dataset will serve as the example, and we will use linear regressions as the primary test.

```{r}
library(vlndr)
library(parsnip)
```
